      <p>Vaporwave is a music genre and art movement that emerged in the early 2010s among Internet communities. It is characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist fascination with retro cultural aesthetics (typically of the 1980s, 1990s, and early-mid 2000s), video games, technology, postmodernism, Japanese culture and advertising, and styles of commercial and popular music such as lounge, smooth jazz and elevator music. Musical sampling is prevalent within the genre, with samples often pitched, layered or altered in classic chopped and screwed style</p>

      <p>Central to the style is often a critical or satirical preoccupation with consumer capitalism, popular culture, and new-age tropes. The visual style of vaporwave, as seen on album covers and in art videos accompanied by the music, is commonly referred to as "aesthetics" (often stylized as "ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ")</p>

      <p>Vaporwave emerged as an internet-birthed style loosely derived from the work of "hypnagogic pop" artists such as Ariel Pink and James Ferraro in previous years. Daniel Lopatin's 2010 release Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1 and Ferraro's own Far Side Virtual are often credited for sparking vaporwave's development, as is Macintosh Plus's Floral Shoppe. In subsequent years, the genre has found wider appeal through websites such as Bandcamp, Soundcloud, Last.fm and 4chan. It continued to evolve in 2013 with acts like Blank Banshee and Saint Pepsi adopting sounds that "have a hint of virtual plaza but significantly transcend it". Subgenres have also appeared, including mallsoft, which "conjures the muzak played in shopping malls".

      In 2015, MTV revealed a rebrand heavily inspired by vaporwave and seapunk. Inversely, Tumblr launched Tumblr TV, with an explicitly 1990s MTV-style visual spin. According to Jordan Pearson of Motherboard, Vice's technology website, this change would mean the death of the genre, as the "cynical impulse that animated vaporwave and its associated Tumblr-based aesthetics is co-opted and erased on both sides—where its source material originates, and where it lives." Artists often embrace classical sculpture, 1990s web design, computer renderings, glitch art, VHS, Cassette Tape, East Asian Artwork, and cyberpunk.

      In November 2015, according to a Rolling Stone "10 artists you need to know" list, 2814's album 新しい日の誕生 (Birth of a New Day) found success within a "small, passionate pocket of the internet." 2814 cited Boards of Canada, Steve Roach, Vangelis, Burial and Sigur Rós as influences. Since the release of this album, a lot of the new releases in the genre have moved towards a more atmospheric and ambient-heavy style. In the same year the album I'll Try Living Like This, by Death's Dynamic Shroud.wmv, was featured at number fifteen on the Fact list of "The 50 Best Albums of 2015". On the same Dream Catalogue label, 회사AUTO released 仙Android in 2015.</p>
